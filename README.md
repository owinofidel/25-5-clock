# 25-5-clock

This is a freeCodeCamp project that uses the pomodoro technique 

On initial load the user can set the "session length" and the "break length" which will later be used in the countdown timer 

Once the timer is started it never stops unless the page is reloaded or the reset button is pressed

Here is a link of the working project [https://owinofidel.github.io/25-5-clock/](Pomodoro-clock)
